Okay, I am going to try to make it clear that it also work in English.
Who said it did not, by the way ?
Thus, you have to actually use complete words, and not abbreviation that you usually use while writing
Like, you can't say that
In english, it is easy to dodge the problem, writing cannot instead of can't, but in French, it is still a problem
